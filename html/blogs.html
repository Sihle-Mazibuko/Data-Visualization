            <h3>Overview of Data Visualisation</h3>
            <p class="blog-preview">
              This blog reflects Qi Li’s
              <span>Overview of Data Visualization</span>
            </p>
            <pre class="blog-content">
                This reading on data visualizations provides a multitude of insights regarding what exactly data
                visualisation is, breaking down the components that make up data visualization (data and
                information), the various ways in which data visualization is depicted and how we interpret the data
                being depicted.

                Being foreign to the concept of visualization I did not have a clear grasp of the topic. Li and contributors
                such as Mackinlay, Schneidermann, Kirk, Reyna, Nelson, etc provided various definitions that provided
                useful insight on the topic but also allowed me to come up with my definition based on my
                understanding of the information presented. Data visualization is the process of presenting data
                graphically, which in turn provides the observer with a way of exploring and analysing data, allowing
                them to detect patterns, correlations and causes in the data sets provided. From this definition, as
                well as others in the reading. Data visualization as a process can achieve this by “exploring real-time
                interaction, on-the-fly processing, visual scalability and user assistance and personalization” (Li, 2020).
                It is also important to note that data visualization consists of data which is unprocessed information
                that cannot be comprehended (which is further split into primary and secondary data), and
                information is data that is processed and can be understood and read. This definition covers the three
                main characteristics of data visualization which are the readability of the data, how the data can be
                recognized from previous iterations and the meaning generated from the form of the visualization.
                There are various forms of visualization techniques used to depict data sets and some of these include
                trees, scatter plots, charts, diagrams etc. Data visualization can be further understood by classifying it
                into two categories: information visualization which is more organized and displayed as a way of
                ensuring users gain the information they may need and scientific visualization whereby the
                visualization forms are simulated as opposed to those in information visualization which are design
                control systems. Going back to the forms of data visualization the reading lists numerous amounts but
                the ones that stood out to me include simulations and volumes and the different types of volumes.
                The reason for this interest is that I have either never seen these forms of visualization or the
                technique interests me. Simulation is the latter as it is more interactive (in some cases) and can display
                interesting data regarding natural phenomena. Volume is interesting due to the vast forms it can take
                on and thus providing a wide selection of ways to visualize data. Some of these techniques are but not
                limited to, emulation which allows transitions to a modern technic from older ones, sliced-based
                which uses a “low computing complexity” (Li, 2020) to visualize certain parts of data and volume
                rendering which converts 3-dimensional data into a 2-dimensional visualization.

                Data visualization as practice seems to be a simple and very useful technique which provides various
                benefits to its users such as being able to take in large amounts of data countering efficiencies, show
                errors or inaccuracies in data, reveal trends and patterns, can tell a story to the viewer, optimizing
                data reports, cutting labour costs, etc. But these affordances can only be achieved by selecting the
                correct visualization and for my assessment’s simulations, graphs and tables are seemingly the best
                techniques to use. Displaying that large amount of data from NASAs APIs can be challenging thus using
                tables and charts (which Li considers to be one the best ways to display data, tables specifically for
                numerical data) along with some sort of simulation for the user to interact with, the website and its
                content will be easily readable, understandable by the viewer and information can be easily extracted
                from it. A practical example of one of the visualisations and its effectiveness is weather.com, which
                predominately tables that list weather information regarding any inputted areas. What makes this
                visualization effective is firstly tables are excellent for numerical values (wind speed, temperature,
                etc.) as well as the design options afforded by tables allow it to look legible and comprehensible on
                the website which is something that can be useful for my own design choices
