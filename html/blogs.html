              <p class="blog-p">
                This reading on data visualizations provides a multitude of
                insights regarding what exactly data visualisation is, breaking
                down the components that makeup data visualization (data and
                information), the various ways in which data visualization is
                depicted and how we interpret the data being depicted.
              </p>
              <p class="blog-p">
                Being foreign to the concept of visualization I did not have a
                clear grasp of the topic. Li and contributors such as Mackinlay,
                Schneidermann, Kirk, Reyna, Nelson, etc. provided various
                definitions that provided useful insight on the topic but also
                allowed me to come up with my definition based on my
                understanding of the information presented. Data visualization
                is the process of presenting data graphically, which in turn
                provides the observer with a way of exploring and analysing
                data, allowing them to detect patterns, correlations and causes
                in the data sets provided. From this definition, as well as
                others in the reading. Data visualization as a process can
                achieve this by
                <q
                  >exploring real-time interaction, on-the-fly processing,
                  visual scalability and user assistance and personalization
                </q>
                (Li, 2020). It is also important to note that data visualization
                consists of data which is unprocessed information that cannot be
                comprehended (which is further split into primary and secondary
                data), and information is data that is processed and can be
                understood and read. This definition covers the three main
                characteristics of data visualization which are the readability
                of the data, how the data can be recognized from previous
                iterations and the meaning generated from the form of the
                visualization. Various visualisation techniques are used to
                depict data sets, including trees, scatter plots, charts,
                diagrams, etc. Data visualization can be further understood by
                classifying it into two categories: information visualization
                which is more organized and displayed as a way of ensuring users
                gain the information they may need and scientific visualization
                whereby the visualization forms are simulated as opposed to
                those in information visualization which are design control
                systems. Going back to the forms of data visualization the
                reading lists numerous amounts but the ones that stood out to me
                include simulations and volumes and the different types of
                volumes. This interest is because I have never seen these forms
                of visualization or the technique interests me. Simulation is
                the latter as it is more interactive (in some cases) and can
                display interesting data regarding natural phenomena. Volume is
                interesting due to the vast forms it can take on thus providing
                a wide selection of ways to visualize data. Some of these
                techniques are but are not limited to, emulation which allows
                transitions to a modern technique from older ones, which uses a
                <q>low computing complexity</q> (Li, 2020) to visualize certain
                parts of data and volume rendering which converts 3-dimensional
                data into a 2-dimensional visualization.

              <p class="blog-p">
                Data visualization as practice seems to be a simple and very
                useful technique which provides various benefits to its users
                such as being able to take in large amounts of data countering
                efficiencies, show errors or inaccuracies in data, reveal trends
                and patterns, tell a story to the viewer, optimizing data
                reports, cutting labour costs, etc. But these affordances can
                only be achieved by selecting the correct visualization and for
                my assessmentâ€™s simulations, graphs and tables are seemingly the
                best techniques to use. Displaying that large amount of data
                from NASA APIs can be challenging thus using tables and charts
                (which Li considers to be one the best ways to display data,
                tables specifically for numerical data) along with some sort of
                simulation for the user to interact with, the website and its
                content will be easily readable, understandable by the viewer
                and information can be easily extracted from it. A practical
                example of one of the visualisations and its effectiveness is
                <a href="https://weather.com/">weather.com</a>, which
                predominately tables that lists weather information regarding
                any inputted areas. What makes this visualization effective is
                firstly tables are excellent for numerical values (wind speed,
                temperature, etc.) as well and the design options afforded by
                tables allow it to look legible and comprehensible on the
                website, which can be useful for my design choices.
