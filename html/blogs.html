          <h2 class="blog-title">Overview of Data Visualization</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">
            This reading on data visualizations provides a multitude of insights
            regarding what exactly data visualisation is, breaking down the
            components that makeup data visualization (data and information),
            the various ways in which data visualization is depicted and how we
            interpret the data being depicted.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">
            Being foreign to the concept of visualization I did not have a clear
            grasp of the topic. Li and contributors such as Mackinlay,
            Schneidermann, Kirk, Reyna, Nelson, etc. provided various
            definitions that provided useful insight on the topic but also
            allowed me to come up with my definition based on my understanding
            of the information presented. Data visualization is the process of
            presenting data graphically, which in turn provides the observer
            with a way of exploring and analysing data, allowing them to detect
            patterns, correlations and causes in the data sets provided. From
            this definition, as well as others in the reading. Data
            visualization as a process can achieve this by
            <q
              >exploring real-time interaction, on-the-fly processing, visual
              scalability and user assistance and personalization
            </q>
            (Li, 2020). It is also important to note that data visualization
            consists of data which is unprocessed information that cannot be
            comprehended (which is further split into primary and secondary
            data), and information is data that is processed and can be
            understood and read. This definition covers the three main
            characteristics of data visualization which are the readability of
            the data, how the data can be recognized from previous iterations
            and the meaning generated from the form of the visualization.
            Various visualisation techniques are used to depict data sets,
            including trees, scatter plots, charts, diagrams, etc. Data
            visualization can be further understood by classifying it into two
            categories: information visualization which is more organized and
            displayed as a way of ensuring users gain the information they may
            need and scientific visualization whereby the visualization forms
            are simulated as opposed to those in information visualization which
            are design control systems. Going back to the forms of data
            visualization the reading lists numerous amounts but the ones that
            stood out to me include simulations and volumes and the different
            types of volumes. This interest is because I have never seen these
            forms of visualization or the technique interests me. Simulation is
            the latter as it is more interactive (in some cases) and can display
            interesting data regarding natural phenomena. Volume is interesting
            due to the vast forms it can take on thus providing a wide selection
            of ways to visualize data. Some of these techniques are but are not
            limited to, emulation which allows transitions to a modern technique
            from older ones, which uses a
            <q>low computing complexity</q> (Li, 2020) to visualize certain
            parts of data and volume rendering which converts 3-dimensional data
            into a 2-dimensional visualization.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">
            Data visualization as practice seems to be a simple and very useful
            technique which provides various benefits to its users such as being
            able to take in large amounts of data countering efficiencies, show
            errors or inaccuracies in data, reveal trends and patterns, tell a
            story to the viewer, optimizing data reports, cutting labour costs,
            etc. But these affordances can only be achieved by selecting the
            correct visualization and for my assessment’s simulations, graphs
            and tables are seemingly the best techniques to use. Displaying that
            large amount of data from NASA APIs can be challenging thus using
            tables and charts (which Li considers to be one the best ways to
            display data, tables specifically for numerical data) along with
            some sort of simulation for the user to interact with, the website
            and its content will be easily readable, understandable by the
            viewer and information can be easily extracted from it. A practical
            example of one of the visualisations and its effectiveness is
            <a href="https://weather.com/">weather.com</a>, which predominately
            tables that lists weather information regarding any inputted areas.
            What makes this visualization effective is firstly tables are
            excellent for numerical values (wind speed, temperature, etc.) as
            well and the design options afforded by tables allow it to look
            legible and comprehensible on the website, which can be useful for
            my design choices.

          <h2 class="blog-title">Critical reflection of proposed UI and UX</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">
            My website aims to inform users with various information from NASA's
            Astronomy Picture of the Day API. To achieve an effective
            communication of this information specific design principles and
            user interface elements work together to provide the viewer of the
            website with an efficient user experience that allows a relatively
            easy perception and understanding of what they are viewing.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">
            For the user interface, important considerations for this site were
            colour and layout. Colour is extremely important in all websites as
            it affects how the user perceives what they see on the website.
            Keeping this in mind neutral colours such as black and white are
            found throughout the site. The use of a black background as opposed
            to traditional white mainly gives the website a more out-of-space
            feel as space is black but also as having a dark background causes
            less strain on the eyes when viewing content in darker areas. The
            combination of a low blue light background (black) and high blue
            light text (white) ensures the user encounters minimal eye strain
            when using the site. The moving background, as seen through the
            white stars, also gives the illusion of travelling through space
            while traversing through the site. To add to this astronomy theme,
            there is a wide variety of colours seen on different pages. This is
            due to space itself having a large variety of colours and the
            pictures being depicted also following the same trend. It is worth
            noting that an overload of colours can cause strain on the viewer
            and as such colours used together be it on the same page or section
            are either complementary or of the same shade to ensure efficient
            colour scheming. Having elements placed in the middle and
            encouraging white space (in this case black) on either side of said
            element allows the eyes to flow naturally down the page. To further
            help this, elements are effectively spaced out to discourage clutter
            and the importance of discouraging clutter is that
            <q
              >clutter makes our visuals appear more complicated than
              necessary</q
            >
            (Knaflic, 2015, p.73). This can lead to cognitive load for the
            viewer as they are unsure of what to view first or what they are
            even looking at. Going back to the layout, different sections on the
            site all have their layout techniques to show that specific content
            belongs to a specific group of information. This was achieved by
            using a few of the Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception namely:
            proximity, similarity, and enclosure. Proximity is seen through how
            each section of the website has spaces around it to show its
            contents belong to only that specific section. Similarity is seen
            through how the aforementioned contents of a particular section all
            have the same traits be it size, colour, or layout. An example of
            this is in the wireframes section, all the images of the wireframes
            are the same size, and the captions of each image also have the same
            colour and text layout. Enclosure is prevalent in each section of
            the website but each for different reasons. The first example of
            enclosure is at the bottom of the homepage as the little cards
            belong to a relevant page and separating them into two individual
            cards shows each serves its purpose and has its importance. The blog
            post page also shows enclosure through the menu item being placed in
            a box once it has been selected. There is minimal iconography used
            with the only two icons being the burger bar menu icon and the
            <q>X</q>
            icon, and this was implemented for smaller screen devices to
            indicate that they can access the navigation menu by pressing it.
            The predominant use of text as icons is to avoid users being
            confused as to what a specific icon means. There are exceptions as
            some icons are generally known to signify specific ideas however
            this generalization cannot be used to assume that all users know the
            same website semantics.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">
            For the user experience, the main focuses were responsiveness,
            interactivity and establishing an information hierarchy. Firstly,
            responsiveness is something to always consider as users will not
            always view the website on one type of medium. Ensuring the content
            is sufficiently scaled across multiple devices ensures the content
            is not only limited to one type of screen and the information is
            always readable. The website can be easily viewed on the most
            commonly used screen sizes. Interactivity is also essential to any
            website and in this one, it is seen through the navigation bar. Each
            text button can lead the user to a specific section of the page and
            having minimal interactive features and only one navigation menu
            ensures the user is not overloaded with features, and sometimes they
            may not know the purpose and function of that feature. Forming an
            information hierarchy in the site allows the user to know what the
            purpose of this site is and what they need to know. Upon loading up
            the site, the user will see a large description followed by a date
            and an image. This already does two things: the user knows what the
            site is about and without reading anything else they know the most
            important information as what you display first tends to be the most
            important part of the site. As you scroll through the site,
            different texts have different sizes. This is again to display the
            importance of certain content. Headings are made bigger as they
            inform the user of what a particular section is, and paragraph
            content is placed right under the heading to ensure the user knows
            that this specific text relates to this overarching topic. Using a
            sans-serif font throughout the site, namely, Helvetica, ensures the
            content is readable as sans-serif is considered on the most legible
            fonts. The site also has a minimalistic feel to it as there are not
            many elements to it, mostly information. This is firstly because the
            site aims to inform and only that and also minimalism is considered
            to be one of the most pleasing aesthetics. Having an aesthetically
            pleasing site ensures users are more able to use the site.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">
            An important consideration when implementing these UI and UX
            elements of this site was who this website is for. It is expected
            that if you wish to view this site you have some interest in
            astronomy and photography. Focusing on the first three reasons, a
            deduction can be made that these types of people wish to be
            informed. The conveying of information without overload or having a
            scarcity of information is difficult to achieve however as seen on
            the site, users are given enough information relevant to what they
            need which is a goal that has been met on this website.
